## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not create a public issue**.  
Instead, report it report vulnerabilities via GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

Please include the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it (if possible)
- The impact it could have
- Any suggested fix (optional)

We aim to respond within **2 business days** and resolve confirmed issues within **7â€“14 days**, depending on severity.

## Our Process

1. You report the vulnerability confidentially.
2. We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation.
3. We work on a fix and prepare a patch release.
4. We may coordinate with the reporter on credit (optional).
5. The fix is released, and we publish a disclosure if appropriate.


## Disclosure Policy

- We support **coordinated disclosure**.
- Please give us reasonable time to resolve the issue before any public disclosure.
- We will acknowledge reporters who help improve project security (unless anonymity is requested).
